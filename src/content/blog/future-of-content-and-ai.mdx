  These days, more and more people are turning to AI chat platforms instead of Google Search.  
  This shift goes beyond convenience—it’s changing how we consume, create, and value content.  
  If we no longer visit original content sources, how will creators get paid?

## The Shift from Search to Chat: More Than Just a UI Change

Lately, I find myself using AI chat platforms more often than traditional search engines.  
At first, it felt like just a more convenient interface. But soon I realized—it’s not just about design.  
It’s changing how I think, how I consume content, and how I interact with creators’ work.

<br />
Two major shifts stand out.
<br />
First, I no longer think through things on my own. I just ask. Before AI chat, I
would search for information, skim through results, and decide which source to trust.
That process required effort, judgment, and engagement. Now, I simply ask the AI—and
I get an answer. No digging, no evaluating.
<br />
Second, I don’t visit original content sources anymore. I read the AI’s answer and
move on. That might seem harmless, but it raises a serious question: If we don’t
visit the original sources, how do content creators earn money? Will more content
end up behind paywalls? Will creators block AI entirely? Will access to quality information
depend on who you know—or what you can afford?
<br />
Let’s dive deeper into these changes.

## No More Thinking, Just Asking

Search used to be an active process. You’d enter a query, sort through links, and choose what to trust.  
That required some level of critical thinking.

Now, with AI chat, all we do is ask.  
You get a summary—good enough for most purposes—with minimal effort.

It’s incredibly convenient. But what does that convenience cost us?  
If we rely on AI to think for us, do we start thinking less ourselves?  
How will this affect our ability to reason, question, or judge what's true?

## No More Creation, Just Reuse

Let’s break this part into three key areas: consumption, creation, and rewards.

### Content Consumption: Who Do We Trust?

A growing number of people are getting tired of AI-generated content.  
It often lacks depth, nuance, or accuracy—especially when no human checks or rewrites it.

But there’s a bigger problem. When we want to verify what the AI tells us… where do we go?  
The “original source” is often just more AI-generated content.  
In that case, what do we even mean by _reliable_ information?

### Content Creation: A Cycle of AI Feeding AI

Many people now use AI to create content. That’s not inherently bad.  
But when content is mass-produced without verification, it spreads misinformation.  
That unverified content then gets picked up and reused by other AIs—creating a feedback loop of mediocrity.

We're stuck in a cycle where AI-generated content feeds other AI models, with little human oversight in between.

### Advertisement and Rewards: No More Clicks

In the past, content creators made money through ads.  
People visited their blogs, watched their videos, and supported them through views and clicks.

But today, we don’t click through. We just read the AI’s response.  
So… how do creators get rewarded?

It’s not just about money. There are no comments, no community, no direct engagement.  
It's all becoming one-way communication. And I don’t think that’s a healthy way forward.

## Conclusion

> [Just changed how AI crawlers scrape the internet - Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/press-releases/2025/cloudflare-just-changed-how-ai-crawlers-scrape-the-internet-at-large/)

Cloudflare recently introduced a feature that lets websites block AI crawlers.  
This could dramatically change how content is shared—and who gets to see it.

In the near future, I believe AI platforms will need to build new systems to directly reward content creators.  
Maybe we’ll see subscription models for verified content, or tipping systems for cited sources.  
Or maybe access to high-quality information will become a premium feature.

Whatever the solution, I hope it leads to a healthier ecosystem—one where both creators and consumers are valued.
